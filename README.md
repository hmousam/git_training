Git Training
------------

Welcome to a boring, useless page on experiments of git during a basic training course!

In this course, I''d be doing some simple commands to learn and explore the awesome git-svn. Do spend some time learning them yourself.

Commands already known or used frequently:

1. `git init`
2. `git add`
3. `git remote add <remote_name_on_local> <.git URL to be added>`
4. `git commit -m "your commit message"`
4. `git push <remote_name_on_local> <branch_to_be_pushed_in_remote>`
5. `git pull <remote_name_on_local> <branch_to_be_pulled_from_remote>`


Other useful ones:

1. `git log`
2. `git diff entity1 entity2`
3. `git commit -a`
