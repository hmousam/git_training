Git Training
------------

Welcome to a boring, useless experiment of learning git in the form of a training course.

In this course, I''d be running some simple commands to learn and explore the awesome git-svn. 

I''d be touching upon learning how to use git by executing git commands inclusive of this repository. Expect some changes here and there as they go with the flow of git and how git operates.

All committed changes are synchronized with this repository which means, if you create a new branch locally, you''d be seeing that new branch here as well, including the changes.

Instructions are segregated in the form of chapters. Go through each one of them to understand what I did and why it reflected like that.

Note: You need to practice along with this tutorial. If you believe you can learn by skimming through, please close the link.

Suitable for beginners and non-git users. For the know-how of git refer to http://git-scm.com/doc. I won''t be touching upon these to make you know how git is designed and behaves like that.

You might also observe some intricate things as to how to create a git-remote repository, why are licenses attached to repos and how the folders are structured.

Enjoy!
