Git Training
------------

Welcome to a boring, useless experiment of learning git in the form of a training course.

What this training is about
------------------------------

In this course, I'd be running some simple commands to learn and explore the git-scm. I'd be touching upon learning how to use git by executing git commands inclusive of this repository. Expect some changes here and there as they go with the flow of git and how git operates. I might be creating branches and what not, so it'd be better if you go through the entire repo to know what is going on. All committed changes are synchronized with this repository which means, if you create a new branch locally, you''d be seeing that new branch here as well, including the changes.

How is the training formulated
---------------------------------

Instructions are segregated in the form of chapters. Go through each one of them to understand what I did and why it reflected like that. There's no hardcore rule to follow every chapter if you're pretty comfortable in them, focus on things that you aren't rather. The motto is to know what you don't know or might know.

To whom is this training intended to
---------------------------------------

You need to have a terminal-enabled OS system. Windows/Linux/Mac OS provide interfaces to use git in the command line. Suitable for beginners who know git in general and for non-git users. SVN people who are switching to git can benefit the most as this deals straight with the task of SCM in git. For the know-how of git refer to http://git-scm.com/doc. I won't be touching upon these to make you know how git is designed.


What can you expect
----------------------

Learning git to be productive in the minimum time possiblevia the command line. SCM is a big part of the software development process and it takes time. What you'd be doing is to lessen the time dedicated for this so that you can be more productive in code. You might also observe some intricate things as to how to create a git-remote repository, why are licenses attached to repos and how the folders are structured.

> You need to practice along with this tutorial. If you believe you can learn by skimming through, then please close this link.

> Seek help from peers who know git better. There's no substitute for a communication over a thousand words of reading.

> The only drawback will be that there's no inter-personal interactions. I hope the words are enough to overcome this by a very little extent. 


Enjoy!
